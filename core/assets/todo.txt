Item framework:
    Converting from inventory objects to entity objects...or same object different uses?
    possibly ItemInfo object that gets passed from inventory object to entity.

    Multiple instance approach:
    Item(String name, Texture texture, Gamemanager gamemanager, Attribute... attributes)

    Multiple class approach:

Concentrate cloneables

Make camera movement pixel perfect
Mob class (impl by Player)

add OnCollideWith(Entity otherEntity) in Entity

add ItemEntity -> InventoryItem conversions and inventory(extends screen?) with Slot grids
